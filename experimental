# **Experimental Framework for Airline Price Prediction**

## **Chapter 1: Methodological Modeling**

### **Section 1.1: Data Acquisition and Preprocessing**

- **Primary Dataset**: Leverage the dataset as outlined in the referenced project report, encompassing variables such as airline names, journey dates, routes, times, and pricing.
- **Supplementary Data Integration**: Enrich the primary dataset with macroeconomic indicators, aviation fuel prices, and seasonal factors to capture external influences on pricing dynamics.
- **Data Cleansing and Normalization**: Apply rigorous preprocessing techniques to ensure data quality and consistency, including normalization of continuous variables and encoding of categorical features.

### **Section 1.2: Experimental Design and Hypothesis Formulation**

- **Predictive Modeling Framework**: Construct a suite of predictive models, including but not limited to Random Forest, Neural Networks, and Gradient Boosting Machines.
- **Hypothesis**: Propose that advanced machine learning techniques can outperform traditional models in predicting airline prices with greater accuracy and reliability.

### **Section 1.3: Model Validation and Results Evaluation**

- **Cross-Validation Strategy**: Implement a k-fold cross-validation method to robustly evaluate model performance, mitigating the risk of overfitting.
- **Performance Metrics**: Employ Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Coefficient of Determination (RÂ²) as primary metrics. For classification elements, if present, utilize the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC).

### **Section 1.4: Comparative Analysis with Existing Models**

- **Benchmarking Against Literature**: Systematically review and compare against state-of-the-art models documented in existing literature.
- **Analytical Framework**: Develop a detailed framework for comparing the novel approach with existing methodologies, focusing on prediction accuracy, computational efficiency, and scalability.
